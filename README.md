# ðŸ“¡ SatNOGs Signal Insights  
Capstone Project â€“ Emerging Talent Program in Computer & Data Science @ MIT University

## ðŸš€ Overview  
This project explores satellite-ground station performance using open data from the SatNOGs network. It combines predictive modeling and dashboard development to deliver actionable insights for satellite operators and enthusiasts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Predict the success rate of satellite observations based on pass parameters  
- Visualize ground station usage trends and satellite activity  
- Build an interactive dashboard for data exploration and insight delivery

## ðŸ§  Skills & Technologies  
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Classification)  
- Feature Engineering & Time-Series Analysis  
- API Integration (SatNOGs API)  
- Dashboarding (Streamlit, Plotly)  
- Deployment (Docker, GitHub)

## ðŸ“Š Key Features  
- Success prediction using elevation, duration, and time-of-day features  
- Observation labeling based on decoded data or audio presence  
- Station activity tracking and satellite coverage visualization  
- Interactive dashboard for real-time exploration

## ðŸ›  Getting Started  
To run the project locally:  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt  
3. Launch the dashboard: streamlit run dashboard/app.py  
4. (Optional) Build Docker image: docker build -t satnogs-insights.
