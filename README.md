## 🎯 Project Overview

**Increasing satellite observation success rates from 49.5% to 88.3% using Machine Learning**

This repository contains the complete MIT Emerging Talent Program capstone project focused on improving satellite observation success for the **SatNOGS (Satellite Networked Open Ground Station)** network. Using 578,000 historical observations, a machine learning system was developed to predict observation success probabilities and support data-driven scheduling decisions.

### 📊 Key Results
- **Success Rate Improvement:** 49.5% → 88.3% (+38.8 pp)
- **Failed Observations Reduced:** 76.8%
- **Best Model:** Tuned Random Forest
- **Model Performance:** 94.6% ROC-AUC
- **Impact:** Nearly double successful observations with the same infrastructure

## 🔬 Technical Journey

### Phase 1 — Domain Study & Data Collection
- Studied SatNOGS architecture and satellite communication fundamentals  
- Collected 12.5M+ raw observations from the SatNOGS database  
- Final cleaned dataset: 578,010 observations (2021–2025)

### Phase 2 — Data Preparation & Exploration
- Removed invalid durations and handled missing values  
- Engineered 24 features (temporal, geographic, geometric)  
- Baseline success rate identified: 49.5%  
- Optimal latitude band discovered: 40.2°–52.7°

### Phase 3 — Machine Learning Modeling
- Resolved a critical data-leakage issue  
- Evaluated models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- Best model: Tuned Random Forest — 94.6% ROC-AUC

### Phase 4 — Interpretation & Business Rules
- Top predictive factors:
  - Archived status (+19.4% success)
  - Observation year
  - Station latitude & altitude
- Four actionable rules for operators:
  1. Priority scheduling for archived & recent observations  
  2. Optimal station selection by geography  
  3. Confidence-based decision thresholds  
  4. Daytime scheduling optimization
